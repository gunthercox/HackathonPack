What is a hackathon?
--------------------
> "The word "hackathon" is a portmanteau of the words "hack" and "marathon",
> where "hack" is used in the sense of playful, exploratory programming, not its
> alternate meaning as a reference to computer crime." A hackathon is a time and
> a place for you to make something. Doesn’t matter if it’s a web app, a mobile
> app, a desktop app, or something in between.

Where can I find hackathons?
----------------------------
There are many hackathons running every weekend, but unfortunately they are not
all in one place. For students in universities in the United States,
[Major League Hacking (MLH)][mlh] provides information on hackathons based on
where they fall within university semesters. In order to attend a MLH-sponsered
hackathon, you must be a student who is either attending a university, or
sometimes a student in a secondary school such as a high school.

For those looking for hackathons outside of the United States, or hackathons
that are not directly associated with universities,
[Hacker League][hacker-league] also sponsors hackathons hosted in both the
United States and internationally. Hacker Leauge also provides information on
hackathons hosted during the summer and hackathons not directly associated with
a university, but instead associated with an external company or cause.

What should I expect?
---------------------
If you are going to your first hackathon it may be unclear what you should
expect when you get there. Most hackathons are 12 to 48 hours in durration and
they typically follow a similar schedule.

1. **The opening ceremony** will introduce event sponsors and speakers. It may
be usefull to mentally note any sponsors that are providing interesting resources
to hackers.
2. **Talking with sponsors** After the opening ceremony, everyone exits to go
meet the sponsors at their booths. This is the time that you will want to spend
acquireing swag, and talking with mentors from sponsors booths to find out more
about what they are providing.
3. **Team building** will be possible if you need additional members
to add to your team or if you need a team to join. You can usually find an event
coordinator after the opening ceremoney to ask about this.
4. **Find your hackerspace**, you will need to find a place for your team to
work. The host should indicate what areas are available for people to use. They
will provide tables to work at and there should be some form of internet
connection available. Since wireless networks can get overloaded at these events
you may want to strategically choose a table near a ethernet port or hub.
5. **Planning / coding**, planning your project is critical. Make sure everyone
is on the same page and knows what there part is.
6. **Not sleeping** Most people end up sleeping for at least a few minutes. Your
hackathon host may provide areas where sleeping is permitted. Otherwise you may
just want to hide put your head down on a folded up hoodie.
7. **Judging** After the coding session, judges will come around to evaluate
each team's project. It will be important that you convey how you used technlogy
provided by sponsors and explain why your creation is a useful hack.
8. **The closing ceremony** is where awards will be distributed.
9. **Going home** It is not a good idea to drive after not sleeping all night.
Make sure that you have a plan for someone to pick you up.

And don't forget: tons of food will be served by the host throught the
hackathon. You should not need to worry about bringing anything to eat.

Team building
=============
Hackathons are great group experiences, but they don't always start off that
way. Whether you are attending a hackathon on your own, or with a group of
others, there are a few things to consider.

Do I need a team?
-----------------
Not always! Many hackathons allow for a team of one, and some people find that
they work better alone on their own projects. It is still recommended to be
near other teams, even if it just means sitting at a table close to some
friends (or new hackers that you meet), as it's always useful to have someone
to bounce ideas or fixes off of, and to socialize with.

Teams are great for larger projects or when you are working with technologies
that you've never tried before. They are also useful if you are attending a
hackathon for the first time, so you can get an idea of what to do (if your
team members aren't also new) or try things out as a group (if nobody has been
before).

What if I want to fly solo?
---------------------------
It's common when you are dedicated to a project to want to work alone. This is
perfectly fine, but it is recommended to sit near an active group or be around
others who are also flying solo.

What makes a good team?
-----------------------
There are a few things to consider when forming teams

- **Balance skills across the team** - Having a team full of people who all
  have the same skills can create gaps, especially when you run into
  roadblocks. Try to create a team with people who share different skills.
- **Find people who are interested** - If you have an idea for a hack to
  create, pitch it to your team members. Working on a project which doesn't
  interest you can get boring, so make sure everyone enjoys what they are
  working on.
- **Find people you can work with** - Have you ever worked on a project with
  someone you didn't want to be with? It's not enjoyable.
- **Break out of your comfort zone** - While it's fun to always hack with your
  friends, try to hack with someone who you have never hacked with before. You
  might be surprised about how it turns out.

How do I find additional team members?
--------------------------------------
Most hackathons will have team building events either ahead of time or right
after the opening ceremony. These events are a great way to find team members
who complement your skill sets, and who are interested in working together to
make a great hack.

If the hackathon is hosted on ChallengePost, there is an option when you
register to tell everyone that you are looking for team members. Look through
the participant list and see if there is anyone who looks like they might be
interested in what you are working on.

The day before
==============
The day before the hackathon, you should make sure that you have done the
following.

1. Create an account on ChallengePost
2. Print a few copies of your resume
3. Pack your bag

In preparation for a hackathon, you should attendees create an account on
[ChallengePost][challengepost]. ChallengePost is where MLH tells hackathons
to handle submissions and many hosts will handle their judging through this
website.

What should I pack?
-------------------
- **A laptop** that you can hack on (*many hackathons provide extra laptops in
the hardware you can borrow*).
- **Power cables and adapters** for your laptop and any devices you may be
bringing.
- **An ethernet cable** - Wireless access points may become unavailable due the
the number of people connecting to them. Be sure to bring an ethernet cable to
connect to the internet with.
- **A large backpack** that can store all of the devices you are bringing as
well as any swag that you accumulate throughout the hackathon.
- Hygiene items (toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, etc.)
- **Comfortable clothing**, you never know what it is going to be like in the
hacking spaces.
- **A pocket folder** with about 10 to 20 copies of your resume.
- **A flash drive** to share files in case sharing them wirelessly isn't an
option.
- **Head phones or earbuds**, the hacking arena can get rather noisey. If your
project ends up using sound in any way it may be a challenge to hear it on your
laptop's speakers. These may also be usefull if you just decide you want to
listen to mucic.

Many of the sponsors who go to hackathons are actively recruiting new employees
or interns. A hackathon can be a great way to get an internship with a company
or get a job and start your career.

Creating the hack
=================
When you're at the hackathon, you will get the chance to meet with sponsors and
learn about what APIs, development tools, and hardware kits they are providing.

Where should I put my code?
---------------------------
This document lives on [GitHub][github], which is a web-based Git hosting
service. There are many other code sharing services out there, like
[Bitbucket][bitbucket] from Atlassian and [CodePlex][codeplex] from Microsoft.
For a hackathon, your team should decide if the project you create will be open
source or private. Most Git hosting services are free for open source projects,
but GitHub requires a paid plan for private projects and CodePlex does not allow
them. Bitbucket allows you to create private projects for free, which allows
enough people for a standard hackathon team.

GitHub also provides [a student developer pack][github-education] that provides
students with free private repositories. The student developer pack also
includes a list of other services that are available to students, many of which
can be useful during hackathons.

What should I watch out for?
----------------------------
If it is your first time at a hackathon, and even if you have been to many
hackathons before, it is useful to know what to watch out for when creating your
hack. We encourage those who have been at hackathons to improve this section (or
the entire guide) with quick tips for those starting out.

1. **Keep it small** - The larger the hack, the longer it is going to take.
You're not there to make a startup, you're there to make a hack.
2. **Make it look good** - You're going to be presenting your hack to others,
polish it up and make it visually appealing.
3. **Look at the sponsors** - Many sponsors will provide hardware or APIs that
you can use, and some even provide the prizes.
4. **Have a plan** - Don't go into a hackathon blind, have an idea of what you
are interested in creating.

Removing sensitive information
------------------------------
You've been creating your hack that uses an impressive third-party API, and you
notice that your API keys are sitting out in the open in your public repository.
Accidents happen, but make sure to remove the keys as soon as possible and more
importantly: generate new ones.

You should never commit keys, passwords, or any other private data to your
repository. Even if it is private, you should still avoid doing it as removal
requires rewriting history and still leaves you in a tough spot.

The first thing you should do when you discover that sensitive information has
been committed to your repository is **invalidate the key or change the
password**. This will ensure that even if someone was able to record the
sensitive information, they will not be able to use it.

Once you have generated new keys and changed your passwords, you should remove
the information from the past commits. Git allows you to rewrite history, along
with most other source control systems, and GitHub provides
[an excellent guide][github-sensitive-data] on removing sensitive information
from your repositories. If the change was recently committed or the repository
does not have many commits, which is typical for a hackathon, you can quickly
remove the information by [amending the commit][amending-commits] after deleting
it.

In order to prevent committing sensitive information, it is best if you put the
sensitive information in a configuration file that is excluded from version
control by a `.gitignore` file. You can distribute the excluded files to your
teammates outside of the repository, and this will prevent anyone from
committing the information.
